This work has no license, putting it under exclusive copyright by default.

This was done intentionally. If you wish to contribute to it or use it for yourself and care about your legal standing, you're in a bit of a pickle and will have to talk to me. However, note that since this was published to Github, I have accepted Github's terms of service. This allows forking and viewing implicitly.
